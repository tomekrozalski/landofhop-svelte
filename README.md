# Land of hop - svelte app

Svelte application with beer catalogue. It is new version of [React Land of Hop](https://github.com/tomekrozalski/landofhop), but with the same [back-end API](https://github.com/tomekrozalski/landofhop-back). I had some issues with React, which I found hard to resolve. That is why I decided to give a try to Svelte.js. Now, when I have experience both with React and Svelte, I can say I like Svelte much more: it makes live easier with transitions, server side rendering, CSS styling, keeping global variables and much more. There are some areas where I find React more convinient: I love creating forms in Formik or i18l with react-intl, but on the other hand I believe Svelte can manage it ever better in the future.
